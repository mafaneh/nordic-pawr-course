![Ultra-Low Power Scalable Bluetooth LE Weather Station small](https://github.com/mafaneh/nordic-pawr-course/assets/5438545/ba47ddee-b1a7-46d4-8d79-81d4abcc808f)
## Course Description
This self-paced, hands-on online course walks you through building a real-world Bluetooth-connected weather station system using the Nordic Semiconductor nRF Connect SDK and the nRF52840 development kit, with a focus on ultra-low power consumption optimization.

It utilizes cutting-edge Bluetooth Low Energy technology features, like Periodic Advertising with Responses (PAwR), which makes it possible to build a large-scale centralized low-power sensor network for the first time using Bluetooth LE. In addition to that, it utilizes a few powerful tools from Nordic Semiconductor, including:

- nRF Connect for VS Code Extension Pack
- nRF Connect for Desktop
- Power Profiler Application
- Power Profiler Kit II (PPK2)
- nRF Connect Mobile App

By the end of the course, you will have a solid understanding of the practical applications of Bluetooth Low Energy, how to optimize for power efficiency, and how to build a large-scale centralized sensor network using PAwR.

- How to optimize the system for ultra-low-power operation
- How to incorporate e-paper displays
- How to incorporate a temperature+humidity sensor
- How to leverage third-party modules available from the Zephyr RTOS ecosystem (LVGL, e-paper drivers, State Machine Framework, Sensor Drivers, etc.)
- How to utilize the different development tools available from Nordic Semiconductor to streamline your development process (e.g., Power Profiler Kit II, nRF Connect for Desktop, nRF Connect for mobile, etc.)

## Prerequisites
- [Required] Nordic DevAcademy nRF Connect SDK Fundamentals course
- [Required] Nordic DevAcademy Bluetooth Low Energy Fundamentals course

## Who Should Enroll?
The course is designed for embedded software engineers, firmware developers, students, makers, or anyone with prior experience with Bluetooth Low Energy development and the nRF Connect SDK/Zephyr RTOS with the goal of developing large-scale, low-power Bluetooth-based centralized systems.

## Who Shouldn’t Enroll?
- Complete beginners in Bluetooth Low Energy development. For those just starting out with Bluetooth LE, it is recommended that they join the Bluetooth Developer Academy and/or take Nordic’s DevAcademy “Bluetooth Low Energy Fundamentals” course.
- Beginners in Zephyr RTOS and nRF Connect SDK development. For those just starting out, taking the Nordic DevAcademy “nRF Connect SDK Fundamentals” course is highly recommended.

## Zero Risk – FREE!
This is a 100% Free course, so there’s no risk in enrolling. The content is also self-paced, so you can take your time and review the material at your leisure.
